Create an account (sign up screen → home screen)
 - When the user first creates an account he/she must enter his/her email, create a password, and enter weight and height.
 
Weight/ BMI tracking (home screen → weight tracking screen)
 - The user can update his/her weight at anytime but he/she will be prompted to do so weekly in order to track progress. In addition, BMI will be tracked based on height and current weight. (weight tracking screen → weight input screen)
 - The user can view progress numerically or graphically. (weight tracking screen → weight progress screen)
 
Exercise tracking (home screen → exercise tracking screen)
 - After each workout, the user can type the description of his/her workout (e.g. 10 reps and 3 sets of…) into a note (and add pictures if desired). The user can also input the time for how long he/she worked out. The user can then tag this note with certain tags for which body part he/she worked out that day (e.g. legs, arms, core, etc.) or what type of training (e.g. cardio, strength training, flexibility, etc.) or rest (because rest days are important). (exercise tracking screen → exercise input screen). The purpose of this is:
have a description of workouts to reference when needed, track what body part was worked out or what type of training was done so that the user can have a well-rounded weekly workout and not accidently repeat certain training when they need rest or to exercise a different muscle.
 - The user can view the statistics of how much time was spent on what body part, what type of training. (exercise tracking screen → exercise stats screen)

Track diet (home screen → diet tracking screen)
 - The user can input exactly what they're eating into a note so he/she can reference it in the future. (diet tracking screen → diet input screen) The user can tag this with certain nutritional tags (e.g. protein, carbs, etc.) or more specifically by food groups (e.g. fruit, vegetables, meat, etc.). The purpose of the diet tracking is not meant to track every calorie but to enable the user to have a general idea what he/she is eating on a consistent basis. (diet tracking screen → diet stats screen) Calorie counting and tracking exact nutritional information is not necessary for most people.
