        <figcaption>After each workout, the user can type the description of his/her workout (e.g. 10 reps and 3 sets ofâ€¦) into a note (and add pictures if desired). The user can also input the time for how long he/she worked out. The user can then tag this note with certain tags for which body part he/she worked out that day (e.g. legs, arms, core, etc.) or what type of training (e.g. cardio, strength training, flexibility, etc.) or rest (because rest days are important).</figcaption>

        <figcaption>
            The user can input exactly what they're eating into a note so he/she can reference it in the future. The user can tag this with certain nutritional tags (e.g. protein, carbs, etc.) or more specifically by food groups (e.g. fruit, vegetables, meat, etc.). The purpose of the diet tracking is not meant to track every calorie but to enable the user to have a general idea what he/she is eating on a consistent basis. Calorie counting and tracking exact nutritional information is not necessary for most people.

            The user can update his/her weight at anytime but he/she will be prompted to do so weekly in order to track progress. In addition, BMI will be tracked based on height and current weight.
            The user can view progress numerically or graphically.
